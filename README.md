# Tic Tac Toe
A tic-tac-toe game with a QT user interface.

NOTE: If you are reading this the program is not done.

The primary purpose of this program is for me to learn vim.  All the editing is
is being done using vim.  When I'm finished hopefully I'll be efficient programming
in vim and also have an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game.
