# Tic Tac Toe
An unbeatable tic-tac-toe game with a QT user interface.  This program uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the computer's best move.  This makes it unbeatable.  You may draw, but you will not win.

Note:
I am aware that the world hardly needs another tic-tac-toe game.  I wanted to learn how to use VIM and the only way to do that is to actually use it for coding.  This program I thought would be about the right size to use for this learning experience.
