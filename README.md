# Tic Tac Toe
An unbeatable tic-tac-toe game with a QT user interface.  This program uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the computer's best move.  This makes the computer unbeatable.  You may draw, but you will not win.

Since it is rather boring to play a game knowing you can't win I've implemented a command line option that will make the computer pick a non-optimal move once in a while.  The option (short form) is -k, and long form --kobayashi-maru.  

Note:
I am aware that the world hardly needs another tic-tac-toe game.  I wanted to learn how to use VIM and the only way to do that is to actually use it for coding.  This program I thought would be about the right size to use for this learning experience.
